**Hi, Iâ€™m Rithvik Rajavelu!**

I'm a M.S. in Computer Science Graduate from Georgia Tech, specializing in Interactive Intelligence. I am currently working as a Software Engineer II at NCR Atleos.

My academic journey is marked by a deep interest in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Structures. My main interests lie in data privacy, ethical AI practices, and the exploration of algorithmic predictions and automation in the workforce. I'm enthusiastic about discovering and advocating for responsible and innovative uses of AI and machine learning technologies.

Professionally, I've sharpened my skills as an intern at Amazon in Search Science and AI, and as a Software Engineering Intern at Publicis Sapient. Additionally, I served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Georgia Tech, where I guided students through software development processes and ethical technology considerations.

My current role at NCR Atleos has me working with Azure OpenAI and Langchain in order to create Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems as a way to optimize the LLMs that we are using for our specific use cases.

When I have the time I love to practice boxing or go skateboarding. I also greatly enjoy taking photos and snowboarding with my friends.

Feel free to check me out on any of my socials.
