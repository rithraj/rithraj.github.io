**Hi, Iâ€™m Rithvik Rajavelu!**

I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, specializing in Interactive Intelligence. My academic journey is marked by a deep interest in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Structures. My main interests lie with data privacy, ethical AI practices, and the exploration of algorithmic predictions and automation in the workforce. I'm enthusiastic about discovering and advocating for responsible and innovative uses of AI and machine learning technologies.

Professionally, I've sharpened my skills as an intern at Amazon in Search Science and AI, and as a Software Engineering Intern at Publicis Sapient. Additionally, I serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Georgia Tech, where I guide students through software development processes and ethical technology considerations.

When I have the time I love to practice boxing or go skateboarding. I also greatly enjoy taking photos and snowboarding with my friends.

Feel free to check me out on any of my socials.
